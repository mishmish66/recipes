\section*{\color{sectioncolor}Ingredients}
\begin{itemize}[align=left]
    \item [5 oz] white sugar
    \item [A bit] molasses (or just substitute some of the white sugar for brown)
    \item [1 stick] butter
    \item [1 tsp] vanilla
    \item [1 tbsp] milk (if using powder emulsifier)
    \item [5 oz] flour
    \item [1/2 tsp] salt (if butter is not salted)
    \item [1/2 tsp] baking soda
    \item [1 tsp] emulsifier (or 1 tbsp liquid aquafaba)
    \item [6 oz] chocolate chips
\end{itemize}

\section*{\color{sectioncolor}Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Preheat the oven to 350-375Â°F depending on your mood.
    \item Whip the butter with the sugar.
    \item Gently fold the molasses, vanilla, and milk in while avoiding deflating the butter (add liquid aquafaba at this stage if using) sometimes additional milk is needed, add until the consistency seems right.
    \item In a separate bowl mix together the flour, baking soda, salt, emulsifier.
    \item Add the flour mixture into the butter mixture mixing slowly ish to avoid totally deflating the butter.
    \item Scoop balls of dough onto a baking sheet.
    \item At this point you can refrigerate the whole sheet (if you refrigerate the balls off the sheet, refrigerate the sheet as well so that the heat from the room temp sheet doesn't melt the fridge temp cookies).
    \item Bake for 10-15 minutes until golden brown.
    \item Let the cookies cool for 2 minutes on the baking sheet.
    \item Then let the cookies cool an additional 10 minutes, ideally on a cooling rack.
\end{enumerate}
